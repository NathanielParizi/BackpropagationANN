# BackpropagationANN
Back-propagation neural network to train on AND OR XOR Boolean logic.

Artificial Neural Networks are modeled after the Perceptron however have
been able to overcome non-linearly separable problems such as XOR logic.
They feature multiple layers proceeding the input nodes which are referred
to as hidden layers. This is a basic shallow feedforward neural network 
with backpropagation trained to predict Boolean logic.
